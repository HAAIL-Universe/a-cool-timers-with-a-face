Class-level `_storage` dict is a mutable default \u2014 works for Phase 0 but fragile if instantiated. Acceptable for proof-of-concept.\n2. `duration` validation missing \u2014 trust that TimerService or the router validates positive integers.\n\nBoth are acceptable patterns in a rapid scaffold. The file is **PASS** and ready for wiring into TimerService.",
